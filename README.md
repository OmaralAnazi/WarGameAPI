# War Game

## Description
"War Game" is an exciting guided project from the Scrimba Front-End Developer Program that allows players to engage in a simplified war game against a computer opponent. In this project, card objects are fetched from an API to simulate card battles. The project delves into various aspects of game development, including strategy, user interaction, and randomization.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Card API (for fetching card objects)

## Learnings
- Created game logic to simulate player actions and computer responses.
- Implemented randomization to introduce unpredictability into the game.
- Designed an engaging user interface to facilitate gameplay.
- Gained insights into the development of interactive games using web technologies and data from external APIs.
